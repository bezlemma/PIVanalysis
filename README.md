This is a set of Matlab codes written on Matlab 2019a to run PIVlab on a set of data,
find the mean velocity for each time point, and calculate the velocity-velocity spatial correlation.

You will need MATLAB to have a path to a PIVlab installation. This code was tested on PIVLab 2.41.

To use the code simply extract the example data set, and run main_example. 

Expected runtime: ~1 minute

Expected output:
There are three outputs for this code
-VEL_TIME_LIST, a time series of mean speeds
-STD_ERR_TIME_LIST, a time series of the standard deviation of the mean speed
-CORR_LIST, a time series of flow correlation lengths."
