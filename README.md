This is a set of Matlab codes written on Matlab 2019a to run PIVlab on a set of data. To run this you will need PIVlab installed
find the mean velocity for each time point, and calculate the velocity-velocity spatial correlation.

To run it you will need MATLAB to have a path to a PIVlab installation. 
Once that is done, simply extract the example data set, and run main_example.
